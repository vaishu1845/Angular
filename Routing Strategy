Routing Stratergy:
---------------------
Before starting implementation of router in our application, it is very important
 to understand and plan what will be our routing stratergy.

   Angular has two different Routing Stratergy:
    1. Path Location Stratergy /
    2. Hash Location Stratergy. -->/#/ is added at the end of the doman url

     Default stratergy that angular chooses is Path Location Stratergy.

      Syntax:
   app module 
   providers:[provide:LocationStratergy, useClass:HashLocationStratergy]

   import {LocationStratergy} from @angular/common

   What is the use of it? While deployiong this application to any cloud platform this will be helpful..

Base href:

<base href="/">
 While developing the application to maintain versioning, we can use base href with deault path

   ng build --base-href="<path_name>";




   Query Parametr: Passing information in the browser URL...
   Paramerterized Routes:
     we can configure and send Parametrs to our routes
      It will make our routes more dynamic..
      Example:

       {path:'films/:id',component: FilmComponent}

       We can read the values from the route and process the logic. in our component.
        
        Set the syntax ready in the app.routing.module.ts



        1. import {ActivateRoute} from @angular/router
        2. inject this Activated Route in the constructor.
        3. Read the values.

RouterLink:

  When this Route is applied to an element in a template, matches the element and 
   that link begins navigation to the route.


Syntax:
      <a,button [routerLink]="'/films'">

      [routerLink]="['/<routePathName>']"
