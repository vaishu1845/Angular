Modules in angular:- 

Modules in angular are logical functional components (multiple components) become part of one component. 

Angular applications are modular and angular has its own modularity system called NgModules.

Q. How does angular knows the modules,services and components..?

Ans:-By decorators.

>>Decorators:- 

Decorators are metadata or type of processing that which angular does.

These are design patterns used to isolate the modification or decoration of a class without modifying the source code.

Decorators are functions takes a single metadata object,whose roperties describe the modules.

--TS feature uses decorators for passing metadata.

--These are called/invoked during runtime.

--decorators are functions that will return a function.

Metadata:-Which contains the informations about the process which we are doing.

>>Types of decorators:-

4 main types of decorators:-

1) class decorators:- a)@NgMdoule b)@Component
2) Property decoratorsfor properties inside classes:- a)Input b)@output 
3) Method decorators for methods inside classes:- a)@HostListener
4) Parameter decorators for parameters inside clas constructor:- a)@Inject 

Each decorator as a unique role.

Decorator always start with symbol @. 

Whenever the decorators are defined those will be imported from @angular/core.
