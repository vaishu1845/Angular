Routing:-

Routing is a mechanism that is used to navigate from one view to the other or from one path to another path 
    .
This mechanism is used by Angulat framework
   
Angular has something called Routing Stratergy..

Angular has built in 'Router' Module which has all the necessaru things that we need to develop, design and implement routing and navigation links.
   
Router module is found in '@angular/router'

Atleaset one instance of router will be available in any angular application.

Router has states which helps us get important information about the current states and data related to router.

Angular handles Routes in so many differnt ways:-

1. Query Parametrs'

2. URL segments

3. default Routes

4. Error Codes

What are Error Codes??

There are different types of error Codes 

1. 2XX -- Success

2. 4XX --> {{401,402,404}} ---Site cannnot reach

3. 5XX --> Server Error

Q.How we will implement this Routing in Angular??

 Each comp can have its own Router.
       
 We difine all the routes in a single file, that file is app.routing.module.ts

        const route: Route []=[];

      Syntax:
      {
         path:'<name of the path>'
         componenet:ComponentName
      }

If path is empty then the route is navigated to the deault path/ empty path...basically a homecomponent

If the path is not found, you need to show, Page Not Found...to handle that we need to have 

           '**' -->PageNot Found Component

Q.What is router-outlet and Why we need outlet?

  
Router outlet is a directive thats available from router library where the router inserts the component that gets matched with the current browser's URL.
    
We can add multiple router outlets in the Angular application which helps in building multiple routing services

    
By default one router-outlet is available in the app.component.html
   
      
Multiple Router Outlets:

    
but the priority of the router outlet is the default one with No outlet Name

   Syntax:
 
  In the router-outlet we have the name attribute to be used

    url/(<outlet_route_name>:<route_path>)
   
    http://localhost:4200/(routeName:films)
